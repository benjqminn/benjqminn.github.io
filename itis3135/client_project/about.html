            <p>
                In addition to running BuiltBunny, Jaylee is currently attending the University of North Carolina at
                Charlotte where she is pursuing a degree in Elementary Education. Her passion for fitness is matched
                only by her desire to inspire and uplift the next generation — both in the classroom and in the gym. Her
                ability to connect, teach, and lead shines through every training session she coaches.
