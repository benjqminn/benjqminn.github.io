        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I’m originally from Lynchburg, Virginia but I’ve lived in Maiden, NC for most of my life (which is a small town roughly an hour from Charlotte). I am 19 years old and some of my hobbies include working out and bodybuilding.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’ve only ever worked part-time jobs before, but I am looking to work in the Computer Science field while continuing my education, ideally an internship in the next year or so.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I also anticipate getting my master’s degree in Cybersecurity and a minor in mathematics.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I don’t have much experience with web-based applications, but I am confident that I can become familiar with HTML pretty quickly!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows PC/Laptop.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking &#38; Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>MATH-1242 - Calculus II: This class is required for my major.</li>
                    <li>ITSC-3688 - Computers &#38; Their Impact on Society: I’m taking this course since its not only required but also I would like to become better at communicating with my peers and public speaking.</li>
                    <li>ITIS-3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: This course is also required and I also thought that it would be interesting (and useful) to learn more about web-based application development.</li>
                    <li>ITSC-2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems: This class is required and I think it would also be useful to know the course material, especially since almost all the information is fundamental to Computer Science.</li>
                    <li>SOCY-1101 - Introduction to Sociology: Unfortunately I only needed one more elective credit hour for my degree so I chose this course because it was the easiest-sounding online course available.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Story:</strong> I’m really interested in bodybuilding and working out in general (a huge part of my life), and eventually I plan on competing professionally as a bodybuilder in competitions.</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>  I love sushi and Japanese food.</li>
        </ul>
