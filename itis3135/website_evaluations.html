            </div>
            <p>
                Apple's website shows off their products and their services, focusing on innovation and user engagement.
                They try and capture user attention with flashy images and quick-paced vibrant product videos.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple's Website uses alternating white on black and black on white background-text combinations,
                making it very easy to read all of the text on the page. All of the colors found on the page contrast very well,
                with the only potential issue being the light-gray fine text along the bottom of the page against a white background.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The consistent use of the same font, similar-sized images, the same sized headers and texts,
                and a defined color palette makes for a seamless user experience and enforces their brand image.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is perfectly aligned across the entire page, making it easy for 
                people on any platform to view the website content without any issues. The consistent alignment makes for a 
                better user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related products and services are all grouped by category and usability, 
                making the navigation easier for the user and allowing people to find what they are looking for without much 
                effort at all. This also means the user doesn't have to search around much in order to find what they need - everything is 
                pretty much accessible from the home page.</li>
            </ul>

                 <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank"><u>Yale School of Art</u></a></h3>
             </div>
            <p>
                Yale School of Art uses a chaotic, contrasting design where it appears their goal is to create 
                a unqiue school landing page that looks and feels like the opposite of traditional website design norms.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Yale School of Art uses varying text and background colors, sometimes making it 
                hard to read certain sentences. There are also images scattered throughout the page that make it hard to see some text 
                elements, such as the school address on the top of the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Lacks consistency in fonts and text sizes as well as colors. This makes it very hard 
                for people to navigate the page and find what they are looking for.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing is aligned and there seem to be random text boxes scattered throughout the page, 
                making it very hard to find what you need. On a desktop, the website is also not centrally aligned and the formatting is 
                left-aligned, making the whole navigation confusing.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Some sections feel really cluttered and close together, while some are really far apart and 
                properly spaced. This makes it harder to read certain parts and I feel it reduces the overall readability of the school's page.</li>
